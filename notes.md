# Notes on Postgres

## Sorting

Based on UTF-8, PostgreSQL sorts characters in this
order:
1. Punctuation marks, including quotes, parentheses, and math
operators
2. Numbers 0 to 9
3. Additional punctuation, including the question mark
4. Capital letters from A to Z
5. More punctuation, including brackets and underscore
6. Lowercase letters a to z
7. Additional punctuation, special characters, and the extended
alphabet

## Pattern Matching

1) The LIKE operator, which is part of the ANSI SQL standard, is case sensitive
2) The ILIKE operator, which is a PostgreSQL-only implementation, is case insensitive
3) Percent sign ( % ) A wildcard matching one or more characters
4) Underscore ( _ ) A wildcard matching just one character

## Indexing Watchout

Even though a column with a serial type auto-increments each time a row is
added, some scenarios will create gaps in the sequence of numbers in the
column. If a row is deleted, for example, the value in that row is never
replaced. Or, if a row insert is aborted, the sequence for the column will still
be incremented.

## Primary Key

A primary key is a column or collection of columns whose values uniquely identify each row in a table. A valid primary key column enforces certain constraints:

1. The column or collection of columns must have a unique value for each row.
2. The column or collection of columns canâ€™t have missing values.

NOTE: Primary key values only need to be unique within a table.

## Foreign Key

A foreign key is a column or collection of columns that constitute primary keys in another table. A foreign key constraint requires a value entered in a column to already exist in the  primary key of the table it references.
Unlike a primary key, a foreign key column can be empty, and it can contain duplicate values.

## Constraints

The UNIQUE constraint guarantees
that values in a column, or a combination of values in more than one
column, are unique.

## Joins

When you join tables in a query, the database connects rows in both
tables where the columns you specified for the join have matching values.
The query results then include columns from both tables if you requested
them as part of the query. You also can use columns from the joined
tables to filter results using a WHERE clause.

## (Inner) Join

We use JOIN, or INNER JOIN, when we want to return rows that have a match
in the columns we used for the join. Only rows that match in both tables are kept. Watchout for this join as there may be unintended loss of data. 

## Left Join and Right Join

In contrast to JOIN, the LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN keywords each return all
rows from one table (left table if LEFT JOIN; right table if RIGHT JOIN) and display blank rows from the other table if no matching values are found in the joined columns.

## Full Outer Join

When you want to see all rows from both tables in a join, regardless of
whether any match, use the FULL OUTER JOIN option. A full outer join is admittedly less useful and used less often than inner and left or right joins. Still, you can use it for a couple of tasks: to merge two data sources that partially overlap or to visualize the degree to which the tables share matching values.

## Cross Join

In a CROSS JOIN query, the result (also known as a Cartesian product) lines up
each row in the left table with each row in the right table to present all
possible combinations of rows.
